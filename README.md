# This is a bot for the game Star Wars the Old Republic (swtor), to handle event sign up on discord.
While designed for SWTOR, this is a simple bot that can be adapted for any game requiring event organisation on discord.
This is a work in progress, feel free to expand on this.

In the requirements are packages to be installed by the heroku cloud.

Leave Procfile without extension.

Get your guild ID from the discord server and replace within the code bot.py: <discord-server-id>
  
Get your channel IDs from your discord server and replace within the code bot.py: <signupchannel-id>, <botchannel-id>
  
Make sure to upload custom emoji to your discord server and use correct ids in the bot.py: <emoji-tank-id>, <emoji-heal-id>, <emoji-dd-id>, <emoji-decline-id>
  
Get your discord bot token from the developer portal and add to bot.py: <your_bot_token>
